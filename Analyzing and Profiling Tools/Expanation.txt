The provided code was inspected with CPU Usage Tool from Visual Studio Performance Profiler.
The hot path indicated that the performance bottleneck was occuring when pbkdf2.GetBytes(20) was called.
The code for Rfc2898DeriveBytes was decompiled and copied in CustomRfc2898DeriveBytes.cs.
Further inspection with the CPU Usage tool showed that the hotpath was in the Func() method which called 
the HashAlgorithm method TryComputeHash() twice and which was causing the bottleneck.
